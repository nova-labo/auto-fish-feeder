# auto-fish-feeder
An auto fish feeding machine mostly built with an Arduino UNO Rev.3, a plastic toy parts, which I _"borrowed"_ from my 7 year-old-son, a micro servo (SG90) and an obsoleted credit card ;-)

## behind-the-scenes story...
We will be on a trip for a week or so. During that time, we will need _"someone"_ to take care of our lovely fish by feeding them every 4 or 5 days. 
_"Umm... Why not we build a machine to do it for us"_, said by son. ;-) I totally agreed with his suggestion, and also I thought it would be an excellent chance for him to learn some basics about electronic engineering, too.
Therefore, we decided to _collaborate_ with each other by utilizing the efficiency and smart functionality provided by the GitHub. And here we are! :-D

## Our plan
We have a rough plan as the following to get everything done by the end of upcoming weeks. _"probably"_

1. Before taking a deep dive into the "physical" real world of electronics, we would like to _"safely"_ prototyping our concept with the help of online simulator such as [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).
2. Take whatever we have prototyped in the virtual world to the real world after making sure everything is going to work as expected.
3. Perform a few fine tuning and/or necessary hardware and software adjustments before finish it off.

## Wokwi demo
The actual code has been tested by using the Wokwi simulator. Try it out!

Well, the journey has just begun ;-)

Happy coding!
Cheers!
